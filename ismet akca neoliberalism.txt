Hegemonic Projects in 
Post-1980 Turkey and the
Changing Forms of Authoritarianism
.
Ismet Akça
The post-1980 period has witnessed the rise of a state-centric analytical approach in both academic and public milieus in explaining the socio-political power relations and form of the state in Turkey, which has become ‘hegemonic but dissident’ (Yalman 2002). In this line of analysis, the authoritarian nature of the state and the political sphere in Turkey is explained solely by the exclusive power of the state elites over other social actors,including dominant classes and social groups. As a result, class-based socio-political power relations and the capitalist crystallisation of the state are rendered invisible and ignored in explaining the authoritarian restructuring of the political sphere and the state. The political horison has likewise been limited to a democratisation discourse understood simply as the implementation of formal-legal reforms and civilianisation vis-à-vis the military tutelage regime (Akça 2010a).
  This chapter draws upon criticisms of such hegemonic state-centric analyses to analyse the socio-political power relations and changing forms of authoritarianism in the post-1980 period through the problematic of hegemony, i.e. through the formation of ‘hegemonic projects’ and ‘accumulation strategies’, as outlined in the introduction of this volume.Although hegemonic projects are manufactured in civil society,political society and the state with the participation of distinct social and political actors, in this chapter I will specifically focus on the level of political society, in which the political parties have exceptional importance in the formation of hegemonic projects in a process of interaction with different social classes and groups.The authoritarianism of the post-1980 period is thus analysed within such a political sociological framework. As Gramsci long ago underlined,‘the ‘normal’ exercise of hegemony on the now classical terrain of the parliamentary regime is characterised by the combination of force and consent, which balance each other reciprocally, without force predominating excessively over consent’ (Gramsci 1999: 80). Or, as Mark Neocleous puts it,‘the question of hegemony is not about coercion or consent, but about coercion and consent’(Neocleous 1996:42).In that sense,this chapter aims to analyse attempts to form capitalist hegemonic projects and to explore the dynamic relationship between consent and coercion within those processes by dividing post-1980 Turkey into four sub-periods.
  The first is the coup d’état of 12 September 1980 and the subsequent military regime.This period can be read through the installation of neoliberal capitalism via militarism,the re-structuring of class-based power relations,and the construction of an authoritarian state form.The second period is the Motherland Party (ANAP) period,which was characterised by a failed attempt at hegemony in the framework of New Right politics.The 1990s, the third sub-period, was marked by a crisis of political hegemony and the dominance of the Neoliberal National Security State. The most recent period, since 2002, has seen the successful implementation of the hegemonic project of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) through neoliberal,conservative and authoritarian populism.
Neoliberal Militarism and Authoritarian Statism
Even though the military coup of 12 September 1980 should not be overemphasised as a factor that explains everything related to the political sociology of our day, it did constitute an important breaking point in the formation of contemporary Turkey.The military intervention was both a consequence of,and a response to,an organic crisis that itself combined crises of capital accumulation and hegemony that had been gradually deepening from the second half of the 1970s onwards.The 1970s were marked by a global accumulation crisis that was manifested in Turkey as the crisis of the inward-oriented accumulation strategy based on import substituting industrialisation policies.The accumulation crisis was organically related to the declining profit rates and its symptomatic manifestation was the lack of foreign currency (Barkey 1990; Keyder 1987; Boratav 1987).After 1977, all fractions of the bourgeoisie agreed to contextualise the crisis in terms of class struggle, specifically by complaining about high wage levels, trade union rights, collective bargaining, and the other rights of the working class (Ozan 2012). The working-class organisations responded by radicalising their struggle in order to resist such attacks.‘The number of strikes and days lost to strikes increased rapidly, from an average of 65 strikes and just under one million days between 1973 and 1976 to 190 strikes and 3.7 million days between 1977 and 1980’(Keyder 1987:192).In short,the second half of the 1970s was a period of protracted and heightened class struggle. By 1978, by putting aside intra-class cleavages for the time being in order to focus on the task of disciplining the working class, fractions of the bourgeoisie came to the conclusion that the adoption of IMF-guided neoliberal austerity measures was inevitable.The economic decisions of 24 January 1980 anticipated both the stability measures and structural adjustment policies guided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) (S?nmez 1980, 1984). However, the minority government of the centre-right Justice Party (AP) did not have the necessary political power to apply them.Instead,it was the military regime that was able to implement them.
  The military intervention was not the inevitable result of the accumulation crisis yet the latter was part of, and a negative factor in, the crisis of hegemony. The political scene was marked by a crisis of representation, which was itself a symptom of the crisis of hegemony.On the one hand,the left populist strategy of the centre-left Republican People’s Party (CHP), which was unable to win enough votes to form a single-party government,was unable to get the consent of the Turkish bourgeoisie or the more radical fractions of the working class (Ataay 2006). On the other hand, the authoritarian populist strategy of the centre-right AP won the support of important sections of the bourgeoisie but lost, to an important extent, its capacity to get the consent of the dominated classes. In the second half of the 1970s, the AP moved closer to radical right parties (both Islamist and nationalist),formed coalition governments with those parties, and consistently called for an authoritarianisation under the parliamentary regime by arguing for the necessity of ‘re-establishing the state authority’ (Cizre-Sakall?og?lu 1993; Demirel 2004). Outside parliamentary politics, the revolutionary leftist politics emerged to become more popularised in the 1970s. However, it too was incapable of developing a counter-hegemonic project due to its engagement in an escalating armed anti-fascist struggle,which isolated radical leftists from ordinary citizens, and also because of the ideological and political crisis which was reflected in the dramatic fragmentation of the socialist and communist left (Ayd?nog?lu 2007; Salah 1984). The political crisis was deepened further by the violent response to the rise of the revolutionary left and working-class movements by the security actors of the state and the fascist movement in Turkey.Thus, because parliamentary politics could not develop a hegemonic project to establish the unity of the dominant classes and gain the consent of the dominated classes,it was unable to deal with Turkey’s multifaceted crisis.
  As a result, all the fractions of the bourgeoisie, together with their political and military representatives, who considered that their survival was at stake, engaged in an open class struggle through authoritarian strategies,first under the civilian regime, then under the military regime (S?nmez 1984). In fact, the 12 September process had already started in 1978.The militarisation of the political sphere had been increasing during the 1970s as the political struggle of the working class and revolutionary left movements became radicalised. From the end of 1978,the major cities were already governed by martial law administration with the military assuming the role of policing everyday life, and using extensive coercion and violence in order to discipline both the radical left political movements and the working class (?skül 1997).The National Security Council closely monitored and intervened in the parliamentary political process (?elik 2008).As Simon Clarke (1992:148) notes,‘a crisis in the state form arises when the working-class challenge to the power of the capital extends to a challenge to the constitutional authority of the state’. By 1980, this was the perception of the Turkish bourgeoisie and the military. It was the political dimension of the protracted class struggle of the 1970s that reflected itself as a crisis of state. In the military officers’ language, this corresponded to a threat to the survival of the state, to state security issues, according to which ‘the constitutional order and the security of life and property was under challenge’.1 A clear illustration of the organic relation between the class struggle and the military intervention came from Halit Narin,the then head of the most radical organisation of the Turkish bourgeoisie, namely the Turkish Confederation of. Employer Associations (TISK). Just before the military intervention, he commented that ‘production will not increase unless the DGMs [State Security Courts] are founded’ and then, just after the military intervention, referring to the workers,added,‘Up until now you laughed,now it is our turn’(Ozan 2012).
  Hector Schamis’ (1991) arguments concerning the Latin American military interventions in the 1970s (Chile and Uruguay in 1973,Argentina in 1976) also apply to Turkey in 1980.That is, these military interventions were qualitatively different from previous bureaucratic authoritarian interventions and military regimes since they totally broke with the previous hegemonic project and accumulation strategy to engage in a total restructuring.‘Their policies display a striking similarity to the neoconservative projects of some advanced industrial countries. Issues such as “ungovernability”,“crisis of the state” and “demand overload” (Schamis 1991: 202) were on their agenda.Their practice was not a deepening of ISI through the political and economic exclusion of popular masses, as was the case with bureaucratic authoritarianism. Rather, they restructured the economy,society and politics through ‘a combination of market economics and repressive tactics’ (Schamis 1991: 207). Since the social and political struggle of the working class was seen as responsible for the organic crisis in question, the main concern of the military regime was ‘putting an end to class-based politics’(Yalman 2002:38).This was also the main prerequisite of the transition to the new accumulation strategy,materialised in the decisions of 24 January 1980. The military regime also implemented the neoliberal stabilisation and structural adjustment policies required by the IMF and WB (S?nmez 1984).
  Ending class-based politics no doubt meant the disciplining of the workingclass movement, the radical left and the democratic social opposition in order to solidify the political power of the bourgeoisie. In this context, the violence and coercion against these societal powers constituted a strategy of discipline in the short run. Under the military regime, more than 650,000 people were detained; police files were opened on about 1,680,000 people; there were 210,000 political trials, in which 7,000 people faced the death penalty; 50 of 517 death penalties were executed; 300 people died in prisons for allegedly unspecified reasons;171 people died from torture;1,680,000 people were classified in police files, 388,000 people were deprived of their right to a passport; 30,000 people were fired from the civil service; 14,000 people lost their citizenship;39 tonnes of published material were destroyed;and 23,677 associations were closed down (?ngider 2005;Maviog?lu 2004).
  The long-term strategy of the military regime included restructuring the institutional architecture of the state, narrowing the political sphere for dominated social classes and groups, limiting the possibilities of political democracy,and the securitisation of the political to inscribe and establish a new balance of forces between classes. In fact, such changes were not specific to countries such as Turkey, nor they can be explained solely by the autonomous political power of the military.This transformation,which can be conceptualised through Poulantzas’ concept of ‘authoritarian statism’, reflected rather a structural tendency of neoliberal capitalism. Poulantzas first used the concept of ‘authoritarian statism’ in 1978 in order to describe the new ‘normal form of state’ under construction in the face of the crisis of capitalism.Authoritarian statism is characterised by:
intensified state control over every sphere of social life combined with radical decline of the institutions of political democracy and with draconian and multiform curtailment of so-called ‘formal’liberties’,the transfer of power from the legislative to the executive and to the limited and upper levels of public administration, the extensive use of decree laws, the decline of law and the elimination of the formal separation of powers, crisis of political representation reflected in the decline of political parties and their statisation by losing their social-class ties. (Poulantzas 2000: 203–204, see also 217–247)
  The Turkish military regime institutionalised such a state form through the 1982 constitution and all the main laws it enacted.Among the 669 laws enacted under the military regime were laws on political parties,elections,trade unions, collective bargaining and strikes,the senior judicial system (Constitutional Court, Court of Appeal,High Council of Judges and Prosecutors),State Security Courts, martial law and the state of emergency. The new juridico-political structure produced by the military regime thus narrowed the boundaries of the political sphere and political participation to a great extent. It favoured a metaphysical, sacred state positioned against the individual and society.All basic and political rights and freedoms were undermined by legal terms open to arbitrary interpretation,such as ‘the survival of the state’,‘national security’,‘public order’ and ‘public morality’. The executive was especially strengthened over the legislative in the name of the creation of a state-strong government-strong administration that could not be touched by societal powers. The decisionmaking mechanisms within the executive were centralised even more through the prime minister, in institutions directly connected to the prime ministry or in institutions such as the National Security Council (MGK).Governmental decrees were frequently used in order to bypass the legislative in favour of the executive. The capacity of political parties to establish organic relations with trade unions and organised social classes and groups was severely undermined.Their scope of activity was severely contracted and their closure was made easier.The universities were put under strict state control by establishing the Council of Higher Education (Y?K) (Parla 1993,1995; Tan?r 2002).
  Organised labour was excluded from the political decision-making process and disciplined economically.Labour union activities were first suspended then severely restricted through the new legislation on trade unions, collective bargaining and strikes (Dog?an 2005 and in this volume).Another strategy was the depoliticisation of class identities and discrediting the trade union movement through the discourse of authoritarian individualism,‘by appealing to virtuous virtues of individuals’(Yalman 2002:41).The military regime differentiated good workers,who were industrious,patriotic and did not define themselves by class identity, from bad workers, who were ideological and oriented towards class struggle.As the leader of the 1980 coup makers,General Kenan Evren,put it:
Industrial peace was disturbed with strikes and similar action slowing down production so that the economy,already suffering from bottlenecks, worsened further because of ideologically inspired strikes . . .All rights of the industrious and patriotic Turkish worker will be safeguarded within the framework of current economic conditions.However,the activities of certain labour bosses who exploit the innocent Turkish worker and resort to all kinds of pressures and tricks to use them in the direction of their own ideological views and personal interests instead of trying to protect workers’rights will never be permitted.All sorts of measures will be taken for all employers to help improve labour peace without deviating from legal rules.(General Secretariat of the National Security Council 1982:27, 231–232)
  The peculiarity of this subsequent authoritarian state form in countries in which the transition to neoliberal capitalism was realised by a military regime is the central role of the military.In Turkey’s constitution,the military bureaucracy was defined as the third organ of the executive,along with the government and the state president.The MGK,which was founded by the 1961 constitution after the military coup of 27 May 1960, was reinforced by the 1980 constitution to become more influential in the political sphere. The number of military members increased and the members are cited one by one, while the power of sanction of MGK decisions was strengthened,the military members’dominance was increased,and its power to enforce decisions was also enhanced.In addition, the content of the ‘national security’concept became so widely defined that all issues pertaining to the political,economic,social and cultural spheres,and both internal and external threats, could be categorised as ‘national security issues’, hence under the authority of military power. The MGK has become an institution collecting data, analysing issues, defining principally the political orientation,and controlling and following up the implementation of policies in all these areas.That is,the MGK and its general secretariat have been given new powers that make it a shadow government.‘A double-headed political system’ both at the executive and juridical levels was created,with the military enjoying prerogatives at political, juridical and economic levels (Cizre-Sakall?og?lu 1997; ?elik 2008;Bayramog?lu 2004).
  The critical point to emphasise here is that this new authoritarian state form was not solely or even primarily the result of the autonomous political power of the Turkish military, as suggested in the hegemonic state-centred paradigm (Akça 2010a).Rather,it was a combined result of neoliberalism and militarism. The securitisation of politics was part of the ‘invalidation of democracy, which lies at the centre of the ‘politics of neoliberalism’ (Munck 2005). As for the technocratisation of economics and politics,which is the other main strategy of ‘the invalidation of democracy’, that was institutionalised by the New Right policies of subsequent civil governments.
The 1980s:The New Right’s Failed Attempt at Hegemony
The transition to an electoral regime took place in November 1983, when the newly founded ANAP got 45 per cent of the votes in the general election from which previous political parties and many of their prominent figures were banned. The ANAP and its leader,Turgut ?zal, followed an almost typically New Right political line, though with some Turkish peculiarities.While the ANAP was able to form a single-party government between 1983 and 1991,its percentage of the vote fell continuously, to 36.3 per cent in 1987, 24 per cent in 1991,and just 21.8 per cent in the local elections of 1989.
  New Right policies, which articulate neoliberalism, conservatism and authoritarianism, may be best characterised as the politics of ‘the free economy and the strong state’, according to which ‘to preserve a free society and a free economy the authority of the state has to be restored’(Gamble 1988:28).Thus, the New Right adopts an anti-statist position that rejects the democratic,welfare state in favour of the market,individualism,civil society,family,and religious and national bonds. Paradoxically, however,‘the state is to be simultaneously rolled back and rolled forward. Non-interventionist and decentralised in some areas, the state is to be highly interventionist and centralised in others . . . more interested in restoring social and political authority throughout society’(Gamble 1988: 28–29). In this sense, the ANAP followed a perfect New Right political line, while also strengthening it with some typical Turkish right-wing populist themes.The latter has always depicted the power bloc in Turkey as composed of the state elites as opposed to the bourgeoisie, the conservative silent majority which in Turkey is included among the dominated classes such as workers and peasants.2
  The ANAP’s hegemonic project was formed by the articulation of three main pillars, just like its counterparts in many different countries: neoliberalism, conservatism and authoritarianism (?zkazanç 1996,2007:15–112).To start with neoliberalism,the ANAP deepened neoliberal economic and social policies,the transition to which had already been realised by the military regime.The ANAP promoted an export-oriented accumulation strategy that was mainly dependent on the reduction of labour costs by politically and economically disciplining the working class (Boratav 2011). The ANAP government also used various incentivising policies, such as tax rebates and preferential loans and credits in order to encourage an export-growth strategy. However, this resulted in a new form of rent-seeking for the Turkish bourgeoisie rather than putting an end to rent-seeking as supporters of the neoliberal market would expect (see Bekmen in this volume). Neoliberalism is not simply related to economic and social policies but also has to do with a new governmental rationality with its construction of a new order of reality.Thus, in Turkey, not only the market economy but also a market society lay at the centre of the Turkish New Right’s hegemonic efforts.Market fetishism was manufactured by presenting the market as the antidote to all socio-economic problems, as the magic instrument of the New Right (Yalman 2009).The New Right’s critique of the democratic,welfare state form was echoed in countries like Turkey in the form of criticising the populist-developmentalist state.Hence,the dismantling of this state form,which had already been started by the military regime,was of primary importance for the ANAP too.The ANAP government centralised economic decision-making in the hands of Prime Minister ?zal, in the institutions directly under his control, and in a very limited number of technocrats closely connected with ?zal (see Bekmen in this volume).By its technocratisation of the economy and centralisation of economic decision-making, the ANAP completed the establishment of the ‘authoritarian statist’form of state.
  Conservatism was the second pillar of the ANAP’s New Right politics, although the military regime had already added an Islamic element to its ideological discourse through its adoption of the Turkish-Islamic synthesis as a strategy for disciplining the social and political movements of the working class and manufacturing national harmony between classes.As for the ANAP, it, in a sense, socialised the Turkish-Islamic synthesis. As a political party bringing together liberal, nationalist and religious-conservative political elites under one roof, the ANAP revitalised the Turkish centre-right’s strategy of conservative modernisation.This allowed it to succeed in ‘manufacturing consent on the part of the masses regarding the promise that it could be possible for them to benefit from the material gains of modernisation while preserving their identity’(Tas¸k?n 2008: 54–55). This strategy has both identity politics and class dimensions. Regarding identity, through its political discourse emphasising the importance of nation, religion and family (Bora 2005), by reinforcing the religious apparatuses of the state, and in its organic connections with various religious communities,the ANAP’s conservative modernisation strategy was able to appeal to the sensitivities of the Sunni Muslim-Turkish identity and integrate those identity groups into its hegemonic project.This also perfectly conformed with the New Right’s anti-statist rhetoric to the extent that this strategy could present itself as an antidote to the Turkish state’s authoritarian secularism and modernisation from above although,in practice,the ANAP never abandoned the use of state power to implement its identity policies. Regarding class, by articulating its conservatism with neoliberalism, the ANAP was also able to present the market as an opportunity for social mobility of those groups.
  The ANAP’s third pillar was authoritarianism.Its use of law and order rhetoric, its preservation of the judicial-political framework constructed by the military regime, and its New Right anti-political technocratic policies provided clear evidence of its authoritarianism.The ANAP both centralised decision-making processes pertaining to economic and social issues and ideologically constructed such issues as technical matters which only experts,not the people,could discuss, reason about,and participate in decision-making.During its eight years in power, rather than dismantling the authoritarian statist form constructed by the preceding military regime, the ANAP continued and extended it by its technocratisation of politics and reinstitutionalisation of the state’s authoritarian architecture.The government’s discourse of law and order, defense of bans on previous political parties and elites and on trade union activities,the continuation of martial law in some cities until 1987 were some of the continuities with the military regime in order to prevent the repoliticisation of the society (Tan?r 2002).In addition,even though the ANAP tried to present itself as being opposed to the military as part of its rhetorical anti-statism, it did not implement any substantive civilianisation reforms apart from some minor,symbolic efforts,such as ?zal’s casual dress while inspecting military troops or his nomination of a Chief of Staff against the military’s own preference,although this was a first in Turkish history.The most the ANAP was able to achieve was the establishment of a kind of division of labour: while the civilian government took responsibility for economic and social policies,the military controlled issues pertaining to political democratisation (Heper and Evin 1988). Such a division of labour assisted the ANAP’s power discourse since it could present the military,the state,rather than the government,as being responsible for the ongoing authoritarianism.
  One of the main characteristics of the ANAP’s New Right policies, which also differentiated it from the classical right-wing populism, is that it was based on a ‘two-nation hegemonic project’.According to Jessop,‘one-nation hegemonic projects’are expansive hegemonic strategies geared towards achieving the support of the whole population through material and symbolic rewards,while ‘two-nation hegemonic projects’ aim for a more limited hegemony that gains only the support of strategically important sectors of the population while passing the costs of the project onto other sectors (the second nation) (Jessop 1990a: 211). In one way or another, a one-nation project has the goal of integrating the subaltern and disadvantaged members of society within its project. Two-nation projects,on the other hand,see no harm in getting rid of the ballast with the understanding that not everybody can or need stay on board.According to Jessop,‘two nation projects require containment and even repression of the “other nation”at the same time as they involve selective access and concessions for the more favoured “nation”’(1990a:211–212).The ANAP,despite its rhetorical references concerning the unity of the nation and the unification of all tendencies,also represented a break from the classic centre-right populism through its New Right political approach,which turned towards a two-nation strategy.
  Economically, politically and culturally, the ANAP’s two-nation hegemonic project was exclusionary and repressive.Economically,the ANAP’s first nation was able to include the different fractions of the bourgeoisie and secular and religiousconservative urban middle classes. Its export-oriented industrialisation strategy, trade liberalisation, post-1989 financial liberalisation, IMF guided economic stabilisation measures,and the disciplining of the working class were all welcomed by the big bourgeoisie which was organised in industry, commerce, and finance at the same time thanks to its use of holding company structures.Even though the big bourgeoisie made some criticisms of the ANAP’s tendency to build clientelistic and informal relations with various capital groups, and demanded a more formal and institutionalised relationship,it nevertheless enjoyed the benefits of these informal relations too.As to the small- and medium-scale bourgeoisie, even though they were critical of financial liberalisation,they also benefited from the ANAP’s anti-labour policies since low industrial wages were an essential element in the export-oriented strategy that these sections of the bourgeoisie depended on for their capital accumulation strategy (Boratav 1995: 76–80).Yet, despite common interests, intra-class cleavages in the bourgeoisie deepened, especially after financial liberalisation in 1989.
  The other important component of the ANAP’s social base was the secular and conservative parts of the urban middle classes. Parallel to the flourishing of sectors such as banking, export and import, advertising, media and various services,new occupational layers mainly composed of managerial and professional white-collar workers emerged relatively quickly.This brought about a process of differentiation among the broader range of Turkey’s middle classes.Whereas these new managerial figures were easily integrated into the premises of the market economy through new career opportunities and consumption patterns, some of the more traditional segments of the middle class,such as teachers,lost ground,in terms of both living standards and status.Although the cultural-cumreligious diversities that would culminate in a fierce political struggle after the second half of the 1990s persisted within these layers, the consolidation of a social stratification that gradually isolated the prosperous from newly impoverished segments of the middle classes became one of the Turkish New Right’s achievements.The ANAP tried to gain the consent of the disadvantaged middle class through various political tactics including, for example, the foundation of the Mass Housing and Public Participation Board (MHPPB),which merged two different funds within the same board.This reflected the ANAP government’s tactical pattern of extending property ownership through both privatisation and mass state-subsidised housing in order to create popular capitalism.Although one of the announced aims of MHPPB was to transfer some of the income from privatisation revenues into mass housing projects that were supposed to solve the lower classes’ housing problems, a survey conducted in 1993 in four cities. . (Istanbul,Ankara,Izmir and Gaziantep) concluded that the policies of the board actually benefitted the middle rather than lower classes (S¸enyap?l? 1996:10).
  Although the ANAP’s two-nation strategy was able to manufacture an urban and market-oriented social base, the second nation of its hegemonic project remained very wide, including workers, peasants, civil servants, the new urban and rural poor, trade unions, leftists, Kurds and Alevis.These societal sectors, excluded from the ANAP’s neoliberal market fetishism and Muslim-Turkish conservative identity politics, were the main social components of a second nation that posed a threat to the wealth and security of the first nation (Tünay 1993; Tas¸k?n 2006). These groups’ dissatisfaction manifested itself in both electoral results and organised working-class activity,such as the spring protests that began in 1989,and the strike by Zonguldak mine workers in 1990–91.For these groups,the social consequences of neoliberal accumulation strategies were increased poverty and unemployment,declining real wages,deteriorating terms of trade for the agricultural sector and reduced social security spending (see Boratav 2011;S?nmez 2009).
  Finally, the ANAP’s hegemonic project also contained some contradictions in its identity policies. On the one hand, the ANAP’s conservatism, based on a Turkish-Sunni Muslim identity, successfully gained the consent of a specific section of the medium-scale, export-oriented bourgeoisie and urban middle class, who defined themselves by their religious identity. On the other hand, it was also exclusive since it was based on the controlled mobilisation of Sunni Islam and ethnic Turkish identity.This particularly alienated Alevis, Kurds and occasionally urban secularists. In addition, by the beginning of the 1990s, the market- and consumption-based cultural orientation triggered during the ANAP period was alienating the party’s religious conservative social base (Tas¸k?n 2006).Thus, as a result of the highly exclusivist nature of its two-nation hegemonic project, the Turkish New Right’s first attempt to develop an expansive hegemony in both the social and political spheres was unsuccessful (Tünay 1993; Yalman 2002;?zkazanç 2007).
The 1990s:The Crisis of Political Hegemony and the Neoliberal National Security State
The 1990s was marked by a protracted crisis of political hegemony and the domination of the military over the political sphere in the form of a neoliberal national security state.The causes of this crisis were twofold:neoliberal economic and social policies, and the militarisation and securitisation of questions of identity politics,such as the Kurdish question and the rise of political Islam.The resulting political vacuum, which was itself partially produced by the military through its securitisation of politics,was in turn filled by the military.
Crisis of Political Hegemony
The 1991 general election results signalled both the demise of the ANAP’s New Right strategy and the rise to power of a coalition between the centre-right True Path Party (DYP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP). In the course of the electoral campaign, these two parties had promised new redistributive policies, political democratisation via a new constitution, and a political solution to the Kurdish question.That is,they addressed the concerns of various sections of the ANAP’s second nation.However,in the aftermath of the 1994 financial crisis and the militarisation of the Kurdish question,the initiatives of the already fragile DYP-SHP coalition faded away rapidly (Saybas¸?l? 1995).
  Looking at the general elections of the 1990s (1991, 1995 and 1999), one observes that the highest percentage of votes for the winning parties ranged between just 21.3 and 27 per cent. The political scene was marked by the fragmentation of centre-right and centre-left (two parties competing with each other in each political position) and also the rise of Islamist (Welfare Party,RP) and radical nationalist (Nationalist Movement Party, MHP) parliamentary parties. Consequently, the governments formed after these elections were weak coalitions,although this situation was not the reason but rather the symptom of Turkey’s political hegemonic crisis (see Ataay 2002:199–215).The picture meant that none of the existing political parties was able to manufacture a successful hegemonic project that would unify the dominant classes and class fractions,get the active or passive consent of the dominated classes and of the social groups suffering from authoritarian laicist,nationalist,statist identity politics.
  The hegemonic crisis of the 1990s had both class and identity politics dimensions. The class dimension directly related to the ravages of neoliberal accumulation strategies,which were exacerbated in the 1990s because of several severe economic crises in 1994, 1999, 2000 and, most devastatingly, 2001.Two capital accumulation strategies dominated this period.The first was financial accumulation, whereby the economy became dependent on, and therefore fragile because of, uncontrolled financial inflows and outflows.The second was an export-oriented strategy based on decreasing labour costs.The economic cost of these accumulation strategies and the resulting economic crises were paid by Turkey’s workers, urban poor, lower middle classes, fixed income receivers, peasants, small businesses, shopkeepers and craftsmen (Yeldan 2001a; Boratav 2011).To the extent that successive coalition governments failed to challenge and/or change these accumulation strategies,which were also forced on them by standard IMF stand-by agreements, they could not get the consent of the dominated classes.
  As to the identity politics dimension of the political hegemony crisis, on which I will elaborate below, at the beginning of the 1990s, the military opted for a new strategy that totally militarised the Kurdish question and destroyed all hopes of a political solution. Similarly, in response to the Islamist RP’s rise to power as a partner in the coalition government that formed after the 1995 elections, the military intervened once again in 1997, through the National Security Council decisions of 28 February. Neither centre-right nor leftist parties opposed the military’s moves to militarise and securitise these issues,and even became active supporters of them. However, their failure to de-securitise and politicise identity questions only deepened their own crises of hegemony. Losing both their popular appeal and ties with Turkey’s excluded social classes and cultural identity groups, these centre-right and centre-left political parties could not differentiate their power discourse and strategy from those of the state elites of the national security state. As a result, they failed to win substantial electoral support to achieve their own hegemony.This crisis of hegemony was then translated into a political instrument by the military for the further securitisation and militarisation of the political sphere.The resulting neoliberal national security state,at the centre of which stood the military,dominated the political sphere throughout the 1990s (?ngen 2002; Bozarslan 2001; ?zcan 2006).
Militarisation of the Kurdish Question:War-Making Is State-Making
It is conventionally acknowledged that war-making has historically been closely related to state-making, with important impacts on the form of the state (see Tilly 1990; Mann 1993). Since 1984,Turkey has also experienced an officially undeclared ‘internal war’in its east and southeast regions that has been a decisive factor in the consolidation of the national security state and the domination of the military over the political sphere.
  This military conflict between the PKK (Partiya Karkaren Kurdistan, Kurdistan Workers’ Party) and the Turkish military began in 1984. It has been reported that between 1984 and 1998 more than 35,000 people were killed, most of whom were civilians. Some 1,179 villages and 6,153 settlements were destroyed,and almost 1 million people were internally displaced (Human Rights Watch 2002).In 1987,emergency rule (OHAL) had already been introduced in the eight provinces of the southeast region, to which five new provinces were added in the following years. The emergency rule vested the provincial governors with extraordinary coercive powers,which increased the domination of the security forces,especially the military,over the daily administration of the region (?skül 2003).
  By 1990, the perception of threat among military officers had already changed.According to both high ranking military officers and civilian security bureaucrats, the PKK had already become a second authority, a rival state-like organisation in the region, claiming to fulfil the functions of the judiciary, taxation, compulsory conscription and so on (K?s¸lal? 1996; Cemal 2003).As a result,the Chief of Staff of the period,General Dog?an Güres¸,stated the change in threat priority in 1993:‘As far as strategic concepts are concerned, I have changed the priorities of the Turkish armed forces vis-à-vis possible threats.From now on,the internal threat is the first priority for the Turkish Army’(quoted in ?zdag? 2007).This perception represented a threshold in the militarisation of the Kurdish question in that the state started to be reorganised to operate as a war machine,using formal and legal,and informal and illegal,structures.
  The first three years of the 1990s were marked by a reorganisation of the military forces.New special commando forces were established within both the army and the police forces.The material infrastructural power of the army was strengthened by new military equipment purchases such as combat helicopters and infrared combat glasses.The army began to change from a division-based structure to a corps-brigade-battalion structure to increase rapid response and mobilisation (Balta Paker 2010). In 1993, at the Emergency Situation Coordination Committee meeting, the area control concept was accepted and it was further decided that,as the main method of area control,villages suspected of supporting the PKK or vulnerable to PKK attacks would be evacuated. Villagers’ willingness to join local paramilitaries, known as temporary village guards, which had originally had a purely military function, soon became a. criterion for differentiating friend from foe (Balta Paker and Akça 2013).JI.	TEM (Jandarma Istihbarat ve Ter?rle Mücadele, Gendarmerie Intelligence and Counterterrorism),despite not even being officially recognised in the 1990s,was founded to run the state’s illegal operations in the name of fighting terrorism (K?l?ç 2010). Village evacuations, human rights violations and unidentified killings became a normal part of everyday life especially in the periphery predominantly inhabited by Kurds. Meanwhile, legal Kurdish political parties were repeatedly banned (Jacoby 2005).
  The changing strategies of the state’s internal war-making not only pertained to a strictly military restructuring but also had effects on state-making at the macro-political and ideological levels.For example,the fact that the country was declared to be at war was used as one of the main reasons for deepening the National Security State structure during the 1990s. All social and political questions were securitised and the politico-ideological terrain colonised by the radicalisation of an exclusivist ethnic Turkish nationalism based on anti-Kurdish sentiments (Balta Paker 2010;Yeg?en 2006). Following Michael Mann’s distinction,Tim Jacoby argues that, whereas ‘in the thirteen predominantly Kurdish provinces of the south-east of the country’ autocratic militarism dominated, in the areas of the country not administered by emergency rule,semi-authoritarian incorporation was dominant. Autocratic militarism is characterised by ‘the repression of all forms of dissent’, and relies on the deployment of both regular security forces and paramilitary formations. Semi-authoritarian incorporation includes both incorporative and exclusionary strategies.That is, it combines ‘limited representation to members of both ‘in’ and ‘out’ groups within the framework of ‘limited electoral democracies’with the use of selective repression and coercion in response to fears of worker radicalism, and ethnic or religious politics (Jacoby 2005).
The Rise of Political Islam and the Further Securitisation of Politics
The vacuum that emerged in the crisis of political hegemony provided the route through which political Islam emerged in the 1990s. The RP, which had replaced the National Outlook (Milli G?rüs¸) movement that had represented Turkish political Islamism since 1970 and gained 11.8 and 8.6 per cent of the votes in the 1973 and 1977 general elections respectively, achieved important electoral successes in the 1990s. First, in the municipal elections of 1994 it got 23 per cent of the vote on the national level,and won in several major cities such. as Istanbul and Ankara.Then,in the 1995 general elections,by winning 21.4 per cent of the vote,it emerged as the leading party to form a coalition government with the centre-right DYP in June 1996,although this only lasted one year.The RP’s rise was the outcome of the crisis of political hegemony and provided an alternative response to this crisis forged in terms of identity politics.During the 1990s, in a period when class-based politics was repressed, identity politics was expressed in both intra- and inter-class-based social unrest.
  The RP’s political Islamism articulated ideological elements such as a culturalist and moralist critique of Westernism, monopolist capitalism and Kemalism as its so-called local representative.The RP’s ideal of a ‘just economic order’ (Adil Düzen), corresponded to a ‘utopian picture of an egalitarian petitbourgeois society composed of individual entrepreneurs’ and a pro-market position; its religious communitarianism was based on the project of multiple legal-orders as a remedy for multi-culturalism and a substitute for democracy;it also incorporated anti-Americanism and anti-Europeanism (Gülalp 1999a, 1999b; S¸en 1995). In this way, the RP’s political Islamism succeeded in representing both some of the winners and losers of neoliberal global capitalism in Turkey through its discourse based on the justice of an Islamic social and political order set against the power bloc of Turkey, which was allegedly composed of a Westernised, culturally estranged, secularist and state-monopolist bureaucracy, the big bourgeoisie and urban middle classes.
  Through such a hegemonic project, the RP formed a multi-class political movement,bringing together small- and medium-scale bourgeoisie,and primarily the provincial pious capitalist class organised under the Association of Independent. Industrialists and Businessmen (M?SIAD),the peripheral segment of the working class, and Turkey’s upwardly mobile, religious-conservative professional middle classes (Gülalp 2001; ?nis¸ 1997).This project drew on three sources of support. First,Turkey’s political Islamists had always been well-organised among small, independent businesses, which were in conflict with the urban-based big bourgeoisie. However, under the changed conditions of export-oriented industrialisation and flexible forms of employment and accumulation,these fractions of the bourgeoisie had gained a new importance to become a newly emerging,dynamic section of industrial capital.This does not mean that this entire fraction of the bourgeoisie was Islamist, but rather that the bourgeoisie that Turkish Islamism relied on came from this fraction of the bourgeoisie.The anti-monopolist,anti-rent seeking, anti-statist elements of the RP’s ‘Just Economic Order’ discourse particularly responded to the criticisms and aspirations of this fraction of the. bourgeoisie, who were very critical of the mainly Istanbul-based major capital groups (holding companies) organised under the Turkish Industry and Business. Association (T?SIAD). The latter fraction of the bourgeoisie had long been integrated within global neoliberal capitalism, profiting from the financial accumulation model due to their control of financial capital and their historically developed preferential access to state resources and protection.The challenging move by this fraction of the capitalist class has become apparent in its ambitions to profit from the privatisation process, in its favouring an alternative form of integration with the world capitalist economy using the discourse of ‘Islam Common Market’ rather than the integration with European Union project, in its attempt to enter into the sectors, such as finance and automotive, previously controlled by big holding companies,in its opposition to the IMF-backed financial accumulation model, which favoured a small number of big capital groups with the capability of controlling the money capital at the expense of small- and medium-scale real sector capital groups.In brief,this new fraction of capital started to be a threat to the big capital of which the military capital was a part.Even the ex-chairman of the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) was complaining about their exclusion from the foreign trips of the. previous government which favoured M?SIAD (Bug?ra 1998; ?nis¸ and Türem 2001; Ug?ur and Alkan 2000; Dog?an 2010b).The RP’s second source of support was the newly emerging segment of the pious professional middle classes, composed of university students and the intelligentsia, which possessed cultural capital and desired upward mobility, yet were blocked because of their Islamic identity. Finally, the ‘Just Economic Order’ appealed to those most unorganised, informal and peripheral fractions of the working class in urban areas who were ‘unable to find secure employment and engaged in marginal activities’ (Gülalp 2001: 445). The RP was able to fill the vacuum created by a historical conjuncture in which left-wing political parties had lost their connections with the urban poor.
  Regarding identity politics, the RP was able to appeal to Sunni-Muslim religiously-conservative voters by politicising their sense of cultural exclusion with its promises to integrate them into economic,cultural and political spheres. In addition, the RP also won support from among the Kurdish electorate by opposing the nationalist-statist-militarist political line of other parties, while aiming to overcome ethnic cleavages through a sense of Muslim brotherhood.
  The RP’s rise to power, and some of its governmental practices, such as its symbolic and practical attempts at increasing Islamic visibility in the public. sphere,its organic relationship with M?SIAD members,its attempts to develop international economic and political cooperation with Islamically-oriented Middle Eastern states,its economic and political voicing of international Islamic alternatives in the face of the hegemony of the USA and the EU (?zcan 1998), all caused the reaction of important social groups in Turkey.The RP’s ideological and political approach to the hegemonic project of political Islam was far from fulfiling the needs of a hegemonic project for the most globalised fractions of the Turkish bourgeoisie,the organised fractions of the working class,the urban and secular middle classes and the political and military elites,who all felt threatened by a Turkish Islamist project.The RP’s rise to governmental power challenged both economic-corporative and political-ideological interests and the orientations of these sections of the population.Domestically,it was this social base that the military intervention of 1997 was able to draw on;internationally,the USA supported the intervention while the EU failed to voice any significant reaction to it.
  Emboldened by this support, the military intervened through the MGK decisions of 28 February 1997, criticising what it claimed were the RP-led government’s ‘anti-secular’ policies.These decisions declared irtica, or Islamic fundamentalism,to be the main threat to the foundations of the Turkish republic (along with Kurdish separatism),and urged the government to take pro-secular policy measures against anti-secular activities (Radikal,31 March 1997).The socalled 28 February process aimed at eradicating the power of political Islam in the political, educational, economic-financial, media and public spheres, and redesigning Turkish politics in line with the ideologies of Turkey’s centre parties. (Bayramog?lu 2001: 282). Soon after the MGK decisions, TOBB, TI. . SK, the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions (Türk-I¸),DIs SK,and the Confederation of Tradesmen and Handicrafts (TESK) formed an initiative called the ‘Five Civilian Initiative’,which actively campaigned against the RP-led government. This cleavage based on identity politics, which has its own dynamics, also overlapped with a separate intra-class cleavage.This explains why, for instance,. T?SIAD, which had started to develop a more liberal democratic orientation under the hegemonic project of European Union membership,did not hesitate to support the military’s intervention and the subsequent policies designed to. discipline so-called Islamist capital. In January 1996, T?SIAD added to its internal regulations that it was committed to secularism (Cizre and ??nar 2003).
  Subsequent pressures from the military pushed the RP-DYP coalition government to resign in May 1997. Shortly after that, in January 1998, the Constitutional Court decided to close RP for anti-secular activities,and banned its key policy makers from politics. Meanwhile, another court case was opened. against M?SIAD for anti-secular activities.The Chief of Staff even released a list of companies that it claimed represented the ‘Islamic bourgeoisie’, asking for them to be boycotted (Cizre and ??nar 2003;Bayramog?lu 2001).To fight the rise of political Islam, the military elites also suggested further Westernisation and integration into the world economy,which they believed would make a political Islamist project impossible (Hürriyet, 4 November 1997).The military’s policy preferences,such as entering the EU,accelerating privatisation integration with the world economy were openly stated in the military’s then secret Document of National Security Policy,updated in 1997.Notably,the military’s 28 February decisions represented a complete reversal of its promotion of the Turkish-Islamic synthesis following the 1980 coup, when it assumed that religious discourse could play a moral and ideological role in consolidating Turkish society in the face of neoliberal capitalism (Atacan 2005;Cizre and ??nar 2003).
  During the 28 February process, the military not only constructed new institutional devices but also adopted a new strategy.A unit called the Western Study Group (Bat? ?al?s¸ma Grubu) was instituted in the general staff headquarters and a new organ called the Prime Ministerial Crisis Management Center (Bas¸bakanl?k Kris Y?netim Merkezi) was founded in January 1998. Meanwhile, the general staff headquarters became very active in addition to its role in the MGK.The military’s new strategy led it to act like a political party constructing its own social support base and actively manufacturing consent for its actions.‘It has appealed directly to the organised groups of the modernised urban-secular sectors’ (Cizre and ??nar 2003: 322). In a sense, the military discovered ‘civil society’,or to put it more accurately,civil society was militarised to a previously unseen extent.For example,the military began holding briefings with representatives of universities, media, business organisations and the bar association, becoming thoroughly entrenched in politics through both formal and informal mechanisms.However,by further exacerbating the statisation and securitisation of Turkish politics,this only deepened the political hegemony crisis (Cizre and ??nar 2003;Bayramog?lu 2001).
  The military intervention of 28 February 1997 arose from the struggle between two different hegemonic projects defended by two social blocs based on crosscutting class alliances and mobilised by the ideological language of. identity politics. On the one side was the social bloc formed by the Istanbulbased big bourgeoisie, which is totally integrated with global capitalism and . its Western power centres, some sections of organised labour (DI.	SK and Türk-I¸), and the urban middle classes. The military was the political actors actively engaged in manufacturing the consent of this social bloc.On the other side was the social bloc composed of the newly emerging conservative Anatolian bourgeoisie, the unorganised working classes in post-Fordist production, the. section of labour organised by Hak-I¸, the union most closely affiliated withs political Islam, and the conservative new middle classes. This bloc was represented politically by the RP, which proposed a new way to integrate into the global capitalist economy through cooperation with Middle Eastern Muslim countries.
  Although the military intervention disciplined Islamic parties and business organisations in the short-term, it actually deepened the existing political hegemonic crisis since the statisation and securitisation of politics encouraged political parties to decouple from dominated social classes and identity groups. After the closure of the RP, its successor, the Virtue Party (Fazilet Partisi, FP), was also closed by the Constitutional Court in June 2001.The triple coalition government that formed after the 1999 elections was not only unable to transcend this hegemonic crisis, but its continuation of neoliberal economic policies also caused the worst economic crisis in the country’s history in 2001. An opposition faction within FP then opted to establish a new party, the AKP. The latter claimed to be a totally new party, whose political position it defined as ‘conservative democrat’, claiming to break with the political Islamists’‘Milli G?rüs¸’past.
The AKP and Its Hegemonic Project:Neoliberal,Conservative, Authoritarian Populism
The 2001 economic crisis was the biggest in Turkish history.Together with the accompanying political crisis and resulting instability, it led to a deeper organic crisis in which almost all political parties became completely discredited in the eyes of the electorate,who held them responsible for the disastrous turn of events. The AKP, which entered the political scene in 2002, just as this organic crisis unfolded,revitalised the neoliberal hegemony by ‘the absorption of Islamism into secular neoliberalism more or less successfully at all levels of the hegemonic formation’(Tug?al 2009:51).The AKP won the 3 November 2002 elections with 34 per cent of the vote and 65 per cent of the seats in Parliament,3 which enabled it to form the first non-coalition government since 1991. The AKP then consolidated its hegemonic power by winning the 22 July 2007 elections with 46.6 per cent of the votes and 62 per cent of the seats in Parliament.In its most recent election victory on 12 June 2011, it won 49.9 per cent of the votes and 62 per cent of the seats. The AKP’s political and electoral performance is exceptional, not only in the post-1980 neoliberal period but also in all Turkish history.The following section analyses the AKP’s hegemonic project and political strategy in terms of neoliberal-conservative-authoritarian populism.
Understanding the AKP’s Hegemonic Project
A successful hegemonic project, including its accumulation strategy, should create unity among fractions of the bourgeoisie, while manufacturing the consent of the dominated classes and articulating to its hegemonic class project other socio-political issues not immediately emanating from class relations.The AKP has succeeded in all these points.It moved to fill the vacuum left by the collapsing centre-right by reinventing a Turkish centre-right-type populist strategy under the rubric of ‘conservative democracy’, though in a totally different historical setting. The AKP’s hegemonic project articulated the following elements:4
• IMF (International Monetary Fund) and WB (World Bank) oriented neoliberal economic policies,especially the realisation of second wave structural reforms;
• redistribution policies based on neoliberal social policy programmes;
• supposedly reformist political policies regarding democratisation understood as a struggle on behalf of an assumed national will against bureaucraticmilitary tutelage;
• conservative modernisation instead of political Islamism,i.e.normalisation of religious conservatism in political, economic, cultural and daily spheres, and the integration of Turkey’s Sunni-Muslim political, economic and cultural elites;
• foreign policies based on a neo-Ottomanist imperial strategy in the Middle East within the framework of US neo-imperialism.
  The AKP’s hegemonic project successfully united the dominant class fractions, gained the consent of the dominated classes, and appealed to important identity groups who had previously felt excluded.To start with the dominant. class fractions,the AKP gained the support of the Istanbul-based big bourgeoisie, the small- and medium-scale bourgeoisie, especially the Muslim-conservative sections of the latter, urban Muslim-conservatives, and also some from the upwardly-mobile secular middle class.These various fractions of the bourgeoisie were united by the AKP’s neoliberal economic policies,based on financial capital inflows and its financial accumulation strategy,privatisation,the reduction of real wages,especially in manufacturing,and the legalisation and extensive use of subcontracting. Even though the AKP’s financial accumulation strategy disadvantaged the export-oriented, small- and medium-scale industrial bourgeoisie, it was able to compensate for this with other policies that systematically reduced. labour costs. While M?SIAD, with organic ties to the AKP, unsurprisingly supported the government,TOBB, a business organisation representing those apparently disadvantaged sections of the bourgeoisie, also gave its support.. T?SIAD,the business organisation representing the big bourgeoisie,which had. struggled against political Islamism and the newly emerging M?SIAD-based bourgeoisie during the 1990s, welcomed the strong AKP government for implementing the second wave neoliberal economic policies and structural reforms of the WB (Ataay and Kalfa 2009).While this does not mean that intraclass contradictions and struggles totally disappeared at the economic-corporate and/or political-hegemonic levels, it does indicate how the AKP successfully articulated different intra-class interests to an important extent (see Bekmen,and Dog?an and Durak in this volume,S?nmez 2009).
  Regarding the dominated classes, which were economically and politically excluded by neoliberal policies, the AKP was particularly successful in gaining the consent of the most unorganised and informal sections of the working class, the rural poor,and housewives by introducing a neoliberal social policy regime. In this, the government was following global concern over governing poverty through the new programmes and strategies developed by the WB since the end of 1990s.This new neoliberal social policy regime included neoliberal poverty reduction and social assistance programmes, workfare programmes, social security reforms that included those hitherto excluded from the formal system, and the extensive use of religious charity organisations.A new model of social policies was implemented in various forms: social aid, the Green Card, conditional cash transfers, free distribution of school books, and the subsistence aid given by both the Social Aid and Solidarity Fund of the Prime Ministry and foundations connected to it at the centre, as well as through local government (?zden in this volume;Y?ld?r?m 2009; Bug?ra 2007; Bug?ra and Keyder 2006; Bug?ra and Adar 2008). Despite the fact that the AKP implemented neoliberal policies at the expense of labour and oppressed organised labour,neoliberal social policies allowed the AKP to manufacture the consent of the urban and rural poor, newly formed due to neoliberal economic policies. These measures, intended to make poverty sustainable rather than eradicating it,undermined the idea of an active,organised and democratic citizenship,yet were still able to gain the passive consent of the dominated classes (Y?ld?r?m 2009).
  The AKP was also able to articulate issues related to identity politics as part of its hegemonic project,especially to get the consent of religiously-conservative Turks and Kurds.Its stance of conservative modernisation promised the so-called ‘silent Muslim majority’ the opportunity ‘to benefit from the material gains of modernisation while preserving their identity’ (Tas¸k?n 2008: 54–55). However, it should be noted that the AKP’s interpretation of cultural conservatism was more marked by the vestiges of political Islamism than its centre-right predecessors (Y?ld?z 2008).For example,it integrated into every sphere of public life Turkey’s religiously conservative economic,political and cultural elites,who had previously felt excluded by their identity. Regarding important questions of identity politics,such as Islam’s relation to secularism and the Kurdish question, the AKP promised political democratisation, understood as the dismantling of the statist-nationalist authoritarian policies of previous governments.
  The articulating element of this hegemonic project has been populism (Y?ld?r?m 2009; Akça 2011;Dinçs¸ahin 2012).I use this much debated concept as a specific mode of politics.As Laclau (2005a:xi) notes,‘populism is,quite simply, a way of constructing the political’.Specifically,populism is a mode of politics that constructs the main axis of political conflict as lying between a power bloc composed of elites and a popular-national bloc.As a political strategy, it divides society into two major antagonistic camps and claims to represent and fulfil both the material and non-material aspirations of the popular-national bloc economically,politically and culturally.‘Dominant class populisms’are also marked by ‘an economic project that utilises widespread redistributive or clientelistic methods’, ‘a top-down process of political mobilisation that . . . bypasses institutionalised forms of mediation’,‘personalistic and paternalistic leadership’,‘a heterogeneous, multi-class political coalition’,and ‘an amorphous or eclectic ideology’(Roberts 1995: 88). Or, as Stavrakakis puts it, populism involves ‘the construction of a symbolic antagonism between ‘the people’ and ‘the elite’ through the notion of unfulfiled demands and an anti-institutional attitude in the discourse of politicians subsequent to a crisis’(Stavrakakis 2005:243).Two remarks should be made about this core definition.Firstly,different types of populist politics (for example rightwing or left-wing populisms) manufacture the power bloc and the popularnational bloc with different social content since they appeal to different social classes and social groups (Laclau 1977). Secondly, populism can be either democratic or authoritarian depending on whether it opens the political sphere to oppressed social classes and social groups and whether it politically empowers or weakens those groups (Hall 1980,1985).
  The AKP, which claims to have broken with its political Islamist roots in previous parties, regenerated Turkish centre-right populism (Sunar 2004; Mert 2007) to make it consonant with the totally new setting of neoliberal capitalism (Y?ld?r?m 2009).In a very similar vein to Turkish centre-right populism,the AKP has also constructed the axis of political conflict as lying between the power bloc composed of the Kemalist state elites and their civilian ties that excluded the ‘nation’ (expressed as millet, a Turkish word which has strong religious connotations) politically, economically, and culturally. It is argued that the bureaucratic elites identified with a top-down Westernist, secularist modernist position dominated over the national bloc composed of both the dominant and the dominated classes whose common point is to constitute the excluded ‘silent Sunni-Muslim majority’. Hence, the AKP’s neoliberal-conservative populism addressed the material and non-material aspirations of the masses by manufacturing a political antagonism between ‘the silent Muslim majority and a disproportionally active and influential Westernist minority’(Tas¸k?n 2008:55). This power bloc and the tutelary regime it constructed are said to be institutionalised in the following state apparatuses:The military, the president, the high judiciary organs (such as Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal, Council of State, High Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors [HSYK]), and the Higher Education Council (Y?K). Turkish right-wing populist rhetoric fits also with the neoliberal anti-statist political and ideological discourse, which depicts the state as the main obstacle for economic development, free market functioning, and business activities.The following quotation from Recep Tayyip Erdog?an speaks for itself:
Do you know what the real problem in Turkey is? Bureaucratic oligarchy. We,as the executive,want to do something.Do you think that we have the easiness that the private sector enjoys. Believe me, we do not have this easiness.We said we would govern according to the merchant mentality. We still think the same.(Yeni S¸afak,19 June 2004) 
  This supposedly anti-statist rhetoric, emanating from the articulation of Turkish right-wing populism and neoliberalism, depicts democratisation as a struggle against the bureaucratic power bloc and the so-called tutelary regime. In the following sections of this chapter,I will discuss whether the AKP’s move against the tutelary regime has brought about democratisation or has been substituted by a new authoritarian state form.
Have EU Candidacy and Civilianisation Brought About Democratisation?
There is no doubt that the AKP, which claimed to have abandoned Turkish political Islamism, namely the National Outlook Movement (‘Milli G?rüs¸ G?mleg?ini 28 S¸ubat’ta ??kartt?k’, Aks¸am, 14 August 2003), has integrated a discourse on democracy and human rights into its party programme and political discourse.The party’s self-identification as ‘conservative democrat’ is also a sign while,recently,the party started to present itself as the advocate and architect of ‘advanced democracy’ in Turkey:‘AK Party defines advanced democracy as an institutionalised and free democracy in which an individual’s indispensable,nontransferrable,immune rights and freedoms can be fulfiled and protected against all kinds of the authority of the state.Advanced democracy is one in which the will of the citizen has a direct impact on state institutions not only through elections but also through decisions and controls exercised by citizens in every aspect of public life’(AK Parti 2012:9).
  Two factors have determined the AKP’s discourse and practices concerning democratisation: its neoliberal-conservative populist power strategy and EU membership requirements. Let’s start with the second stimulus, namely the EU project. In the post-1999 period,Turkey’s accession to the EU has become the main political issue of domestic politics.The majority of different sections of the population, from the ex-Islamist to Kurdish political movements, from almost all fractions of the bourgeoisie to a significant part of organised labour, and unorganised popular sections, saw EU candidacy as the magical device that would solve Turkey’s economic, social, political and cultural problems. In that sense, EU membership was constructed by conservative, liberal and left-liberal circles as a perfect hegemonic apparatus.The AKP’s pro-EU stance (Usul 2008; Dog?an 2005) has had two effects.First,it has functioned as a hegemonic apparatus to get the consent of the dominated classes and other repressed social groups. Secondly, it has served to consolidate the AKP’s political power vis-à-vis the military and secular establishment.
  The AKP’s democratisation reforms have been limited to some constitutional and legal changes through reform packages required for EU membership, especially between 2002 and 2005, which was a period of ‘Euro-enthusiasm’ (Usul 2008).Those reforms covered the following areas: abolition of the death penalty,accepting the constitutional supremacy of international law over domestic law, the abolition of State Security Courts, reinforcing constitutional equality between sexes,some minor changes in the Penal Code and Anti-Terror Law and, most importantly,several reforms concerning civil-military relations that curbed the autonomous political power of the military (see below).Although some EU reforms have been important (see Hale and ?zbudun 2010: 55–67), most have had no real impact on making state–society relations more democratic.
  The EU reform process slowed down in the aftermath of the rejection of the proposed EU constitution in France and the Netherlands in 2005, which was interpreted by Turkish public opinion and the government as signalling resistance to Turkey’s membership.The post-2006 period, and especially after 2007, was marked by a new wave of authoritarianism. In particular, government legislation has been in the direction of reversing its earlier reforms in some of the most critical EU reform areas, such as the Anti-Terror Law, freedom of expression and State Security Courts (see below). Overall, the AKP ‘lacks a practical democratisation agenda independent from EU membership requirements’(??nar 2008:122).
  The core of EU-stimulated reform packages has concerned civilianisation by curbing the ‘autonomous political power of the military’ (Cizre 2008b).This brings us to the first factor,namely that a neoliberal-conservative populist power strategy determined the AKP’s understanding of democracy.This has been based on the idea of representing ‘the national will’ against the state elite’s tutelage, against the status quo materialised in the apparatuses of the tutelary regime. It therefore includes the minimum of democracy:the formation of political power through electoral process.This understanding of democracy has been one of the main stimuli behind the AKP’s political reformism, since the secular state establishment has had strong suspicions about,if not belief in,the party’s alleged hidden Islamic intentions.In other words,the AKP’s political Islamist legacy has paradoxically forced it to engage in a more reformist stance than its right-wing predecessors. Hence, the AKP has mainly defined democratisation as ‘the normalisation of the Turkish political system’(Akdog?an 2006:52).
  The AKP’s claim to political reformism in dismantling the tutelary regime has been most clearly evidenced in its struggle against the military and its civilianisation reforms (Akça and Balta Paker 2013;Cizre 2008b).The AKP did not have the opportunity granted to its centre-right predecessors, which the military regarded as more or less legitimate political actors, to develop relatively stable relations and alliances with the military. Instead, hardliners within the military have perceived the AKP government as the successor to the political Islamist movement, seeing it as a threat to the secular foundations of the Turkish Republic.As a result,the AKP,despite its willingness,has been unable to develop good relations with the military,choosing instead to carry out legal and institutional reforms to limit the military’s political role, both as a requirement of the EU accession process and also to consolidate its own political power.Two other main reasons also pushed the AKP to introduce civilianisation reforms.The first is that the AKP’s struggle against the core actor of the tutelary regime, namely the military,has helped its neoliberal-conservative populist strategy.The second is that its neo-Ottomanist desire to become an imperial power in the Middle East could not be realised so long as the military remained politically autonomous from the government.
  Hence, between 2002 and 2005, the AKP engaged in a ‘war of position’ against the military, to use Gramsci’s term, especially by using Turkey’s EU candidacy for leverage.This legitimated its curbs on the power of the MGK and the Secretariat General. For example, the Seventh EU Harmonisation Package, passed on 7 August 2003,made significant amendments to the composition,role and functions of both the MGK and the Secretariat General. The MGK, previously the main institution of military influence,was transformed from being an executive decision-making board into an advisory board. Moreover, the internal composition of the MGK was radically altered:the majority of members were now to be civilians,while its post of secretariat,which had always been held by a high-ranking general, could now be a civilian appointed by the president from a list of candidates selected by the prime minister.Even more importantly, the frequency of MGK meetings was decreased to once every two months instead of monthly.This amendment indirectly but effectively decreased the MGK’s importance in domestic policy making.Moreover,through amendments to the Law on the Establishment of and Broadcasting by Radio and Television Corporations,Wireless Communication, and the Protection of Minors from Harmful Publications, the MGK’s prior authority to nominate one member to each relevant board was ended. Besides the amendment to the structure and responsibilities of the MGK, parliament annulled the provision in the Law on Higher Education that allowed the General Staff to select one member of the Higher Education Council (Akça and Balta Paker 2013:80).During this period, in order to weaken the AKP government,the military elites took several actions, ranging from coup attempts to the promotion of anti-AKP public campaigns. Although there were signs that the AKP’s leaders were aware of these attempted coups against their government back in 2003 and 2004, given its relatively narrow electoral base at that time and its inability to penetrate state institutions, the AKP did not feel strong enough to wage a war of manoeuvre, so did not struggle against these attempts.In the event,the military’s attempts to unseat the government failed anyway because they had a narrow social base and hardly any international support. However, the AKP government’s rather passive stance paved the way for a counter attack by the military in the following period, marked by the slowing down of EU reforms and the remilitarisation of the Kurdish question (Akça and Balta Paker 2013:81–82).
  The AKP had tried to forge relatively close relations with the military by taking an anti-Kurdish movement stance,for instance by making amendments to the Anti-Terror Law. However, this tactic collapsed during the presidential candidacy debate in spring 2007 when the AKP proposed the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Gül, as its presidential candidate. The military opposed his candidacy because Gül’s wife wears a headscarf, with the Turkish General Staff publishing a memorandum on its website, later called the ‘e-memorandum’, on 27 April 2007 warning of the danger to secularism.In addition,when parliament voted for Gül, the Constitutional Court also tried to block his candidacy at the behest of the opposition CHP by reaching a totally arbitrary decision concerning the minimum number of parliamentary deputies required for the vote for the presidential candidate to be valid.However,the government easily circumvented this obstacle by calling early general elections in July 2007, which led both to a greater share of the vote and parliamentary seats,and Gül’s taking the presidency. On March 2008, the opposition to the AKP struck back when the chief prosecutor opened a case to close the AKP (Akça and Balta Paker 2013:83–84).
  These events pushed the AKP to shift its strategy towards open struggle against the military.Already,between 2002 and 2007,the AKP government had been able to penetrate – albeit to a limited extent – the judiciary and begin to exert more extensive influence over the police.During the new period,however, its increasing control over the police and judiciary would become crucial as the government launched an offensive against the military based on allegations of military-inspired plots to overthrow the government. On 20 October 2008, following the uncovering of an arms dump and associated documents in an. Istanbul house, the Ergenekon trial began.The trial led to waves of arrests of academics,politicians,journalists,lawyers,businessmen and high-ranking serving and retired military officials.Among the charges levelled in the indictment are ‘membership of an armed terrorist group,aiding and abetting an armed terrorist organisation, attempting to destroy the government of the Republic of Turkey or to block it from performing its duties, inciting people to rebel against the Republic of Turkey, being in possession of explosives, using them, and inciting others to commit these crimes, acquiring secret documents on national security’ (Park 2008). In February 2010, further arrests led to a trial called ‘Balyoz’ (Sledgehammer),named after an alleged 2003 plot to foment chaos and destabilise the government in order to justify a military coup.Recently,the court imposed jail sentences of around 20 years for many high ranking officers, including former chiefs of the air, navy and land forces. Most recently, in the Supreme Military Council meetings of August 2010 and 2011, the AKP government vetoed proposed promotions of several high-ranking generals due to their alleged connections to coup plotters (Akça and Balta Paker 2013:86).
  By 2013, we can say that the AKP has won its political battle against the military,and there is no doubt that this civilianisation has been an important step towards democratisation.However,such civilianisation by itself is a necessary but not sufficient condition for democratisation, and in Turkey it has not brought about democratisation for two reasons.Firstly,civilianisation remains incomplete because there are still functions that should be under the competence of the civilian authorities but have not yet achieved this, such as the military budget, internal security and intelligence gathering.In addition,the subject areas of NSC meetings are still too broad, while the military retains an important role in internal security through specific institutions, the chief of general staff still has authority and prerogatives in areas other than strictly external security issues, parliamentary control over the military does not work effectively, and the military’s economic power remains untouched (Akay 2009; Akça 2010b).More importantly, there is convincing evidence that the credibility of the Ergenekon and Balyoz trials has been undermined because the revanchist political concerns of the government took precedence over legal procedures and obligations.This has led even those sections of the public that have consistently supported civilianisation to express unease and question the legality and impartiality of the trial process.The second weakness of current civilianisation is that the AKP government, having begun the process, did not go further to establish a democratic state form but instead manufactured a civilian authoritarian state form. Conquering the State, Preserving the Authoritarian State Form
One of the main criteria of democratisation is that the state form changes so as to reduce the limits imposed on the political sphere,which necessitates a change in the state form. However, the anti-statist rhetoric and practice of the AKP’s neoliberal-conservative populism was trapped within its critique of the Kemalist state elites’control of the state apparatuses rather than the state form per se.Thus, the party’s populist rhetoric claims that ‘the reconquering of the political, cultural and economic echelons is a just and legitimate act in renewing their authenticity or in returning them to the long-excluded genuine sons of the Millet [nation]’ (Tas¸k?n 2008: 55). Hence, the AKP’s claim to unite the nation with its own state was limited to having the state conquered by the supposedly genuine representatives of the Sunni Muslim and Turk millet.Having defeated the military on the political battleground, the AKP then attempted to gain control of the other apparatuses of the so-called tutelary regime, including the presidency and Y?K after the presidential elections.However,harder work was needed to gain control of the high judicial organs.This was achieved through the constitutional amendments concerning the Constitutional Court and High Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors, passed in the 12 September 2010 referendum,which opened the way for the executive (both the government and the presidency) to exert control over these juridical apparatuses and ensure their takeover by pro-AKP cadres (Akça 2010c;Atikcan and ?g?e 2012:9).
  Thus,the AKP’s main concern was conquering the state apparatuses by a new neoliberal-conservative elite group rather than reforming the authoritarian state form. In this sense, the AKP’s understanding of democracy fails to include a structural democratic transformation of the relationship between state and society,politics and society,and between various groups in society (??nar 2008: 122).Many critical analyses of neoliberalism have long emphasised that the real practice of the politics of neoliberalism has been the invalidation of democracy and the de-politicisation of politics (Munck 2005;Bonefeld 2006).In particular, the technocratisation of economic and social policy issues, the policing of dissident voices through securitisation and penalisation have contracted the political sphere.The structural tendency of neoliberalism has been towards an authoritarian state form that the dominated classes cannot penetrate.As underlined above,through its civilianisation reforms,the AKP certainly dismantled the military-centred Neoliberal National Security State. Unfortunately, however, it substituted it with a police and judiciary-centred security state form.Although the AKP government has always claimed to be establishing a balance between security and freedoms, it gives priority to the former as the precondition for democracy with its rights and freedoms.In other words,security has been at the centre of the AKP’s political and governing rationality. However, as Neocleous remarks, such seemingly liberal claims about the need to balance security and liberty have always severely restricted freedoms, and provided ‘illiberal justifications for a range of extreme and dangerous security measures’ (Neocleous 2008:12).This has been the case for the AKP period in Turkey too.
  A new state form has emerged under the AKP period,at the centre of which now stand the police and the judiciary in place of the military. This new authoritarian state form has been constructed through a series of legal changes, particularly after 2005.In 2005,the new Penal Code redefined terror crimes in a way that included many legitimate political and social protest acts,while special courts for serious crimes (?zel Yetkili Mahkemeler) replaced the old State Security Courts.A very broad range of crimes have been included within the competence of exceptional trial processes. For example, changes in the Anti-Terror Law of 2006 defined 50 crimes that were previously listed under the Penal Code as terror crimes if ‘they are committed as acts of a terrorist organisation’.These legal changes give extraordinary discretionary power to specially authorised prosecutors.With these changes,a penal system has emerged that creates a huge state of exception.The latter allows the police and the judiciary to work with specific. reference to the idea of an ‘enemy’as if they are at war (Inan?c? 2011).Terrorism is the key to this state of exception in that it is not the act itself but the person acting that is punished.Thus, Penal Code article 220/6 defines a terrorist as follows:‘even if a person is not a member of a terrorist organisation, if he acts in the name or in favour of the terrorist organisation, he will be treated as a terrorist’.Similarly,the definitions of terror and terrorist in the Anti-Terror Law are so broadly defined that a very broad range of issues, actors and acts may be deliberately and arbitrarily treated as involving terror or terrorists (G?ktas¸ 2012).
  This new form of state of exception makes a distinction between the ‘acceptable’ citizen and the terrorist, with the latter deemed to fall within the scope of an exceptional legal order.Besides socialists and Kurds,who have always been defined as ‘internal enemies’, now the Kemalist elites (civil and military bureaucrats,journalists,academic scholars etc.) are also treated as enemies of the state.The key point here is that the decision about who will be seen as citizen or terrorist is now directly taken by the ‘sovereign’, to use Agamben’s term (Agamben 1998).In Turkey,this sovereign is currently the AKP government,the police and judiciary,who are,to an important extent,under the control of either the party or the allied Fethullah Gülen community (Ertekin 2011; ?zsu and Ertekin 2013; S¸?k 2011, 2012). Political crimes have been replaced by the term terror and terrorist so that,on the one hand,it links itself to a ‘political’activity, hence making politics appear to be something bad, while on the other hand, it delegitimises various political acts as if they were violent (Ertekin 2012).
  There is no doubt that,after 12 September 1980,the military regime and the subsequent Neoliberal National Security State of the 1990s used the judiciary to implement the political decisions of the militarist-authoritarian state’s elites against the social and political opposition (especially,Kurdish,Islamist and radical leftist movements,but also the labour and student movements) and as an obstacle to democratic politics.Indeed,during the first AKP government’s early years,the judiciary continued to play the same role against the AKP itself (Hale and ?zbudun 2010: 74–75). However, especially during the second half of the AKP period,the judiciary has become a direct actor rather than a mere implementer. In this new neoliberal penal state, politics has become ‘judicialised’ once again, with so-called ‘political crimes’ criminalised as terrorist acts and, most importantly,to cite Agamben (1998) again,the political sphere has been dominated by ‘the criminalisation of the political adversary’.That is, the whole range of social and political opposition to the AKP, be it Kemalist-nationalist, socialist left or Kurdish,is constructed as part of terrorist organisations and activities against the state,which the AKP now identifies with itself.Many trials were opened by the special serious crimes courts, known variously as Ergenekon, OdaTV, Devrimci Karargah and KCK (Kurdistan Communities Union). The lack of a separate judicial police force has also resulted in an increase in the discretionary power of the police forces,allowing the latter to dominate the prosecutors rather than vice versa. Consequently, police reports are reproduced almost identically in prosecutors’ indictments, which are also based on clearly political analyses and evalu-. ations (Inan?c? 2012). This juridico-political structure has severely damaged freedoms of the press,speech,assembly and association in Turkey.
  The police forces,too,have been at the centre of this new authoritarian state form through the function of social control.The neoliberal restructuring of the Turkish police force in line with global developments has created a new state apparatus appropriate for policing the poor and dissidents (Berksoy 2010,2012). This represents a transition from ‘a post- to a pre-crime society’, in which ‘the pre-crime logic of security aims at forestalling risks and preventing that which has not yet occurred and may never do so’ (Zedner 2007: 262).As the strategic plan for 2009–2013 of the Turkish police forces states:‘The aim is to increase the capacity to dissuade those with the intention to commit a crime’ (Berksoy 2012: 82).The idea of proactive policing introduced by the neoliberal security paradigm, aims to survey, control and passify the potential criminal rather than find and punish the actual criminal (G?nen 2012).Analysis of the professional socialisation of police officers shows that their professional education defines social protest as the irrational, emotional, savage and destructive, instinctoriented acts of the masses, who should be treated as the enemy as if in a war (Uysal 2012).This justifies the use of force to repress any collective protest. Differentiating the so-called terrorist from the citizen is now the responsibility of the new sovereigns,namely the government,the judiciary,and the police.As the terrorist is seen as ‘bare life’in Agamben’s (1998) sense,the use of force and punishment becomes the main governing rationality for policing dissident and oppositional forces.
Repressing the Social and Political Opposition
On the one hand, democracy is about ‘juridically formalised conditions’, including popular sovereignty based on free elections,‘legal freedoms of speech, conscience, assembly, association and the press, backed by the rights under the law and freedom from arrest without trial’ (Eley 2007: 182). In Turkey, these conditions have been undermined by the police and judiciary-centred neoliberal security state constructed and endorsed by the AKP in which an anti-democratic parliamentarian regime currently dominates. On the other hand, as historical experience shows, democracy and democratisation are also, even mainly, about the expansion of democratic capacities to all social classes and groups through their own autonomous collective actions,through social and economic conflicts and struggles,through popular mobilisations of unusual intensity and scale (Eley 2007:184,200).The AKP’s neoliberal-conservative populism has failed here too in that, when confronted with collective and popular protests, it has opted for repressive measures.
  This situation is the combined result of neoliberalism and the Turkish rightwing populism’s monolithic view of the national will. The policies of neoliberalism are based on the contraction of the political sphere and the exclusion of the dominated social classes and groups when they act through their own autonomous will and organisations. Neoliberal populism has manufactured consent for neoliberal capitalism by gaining the passive consent of the masses without actively mobilising them. As Weyland (2001: 16) notes, neoliberal populism is ‘less institutionalised’, ‘adopts a more anti-organisational stance, reaches followers in the private sphere,and depends on the confidential responses of individual citizens,not on collective manifestations by the people in the public sphere’. Like Turkish right-wing populism, the AKP’s neoliberal-conservative populism is based on a chain of equivalence between democracy,the will of the nation, the will of the electoral majority, the will of the party in government and the will of the AKP’s leader.According to the political rationality of this chain of equivalence,any other voices other than that of the party in power,its leader and its supporters are deemed as not part of the national will and hence not worthy of democratic consideration.The result has been a very monolithic understanding of the national will and a majoritarian understanding of democracy. Even those scholars who are not radically critical of the AKP, such as M. Hakan Yavuz, have noted the problem of its identification of the ‘moral majority’with Sunni-Hanafi Muslims:
While the AKP believes that it represents the values of ‘the nation’, it has not still developed a political discourse recognising and protecting the differences that were silenced in its abstracted view of the nation . . .what the party understands from ‘the nation’is restricted to the Hanafi-Turkish element and the ‘demands’ introduced by the party are also limited to those of the Hanafi-Turks.(Yavuz 2004) 
  In fact,the AKP’s ‘conservative democrat’approach does recognise differences at the level of society but denies the power relations between them by claiming their harmonious unity’(??nar 2008:122;AK Parti 2012:5).Thus,according to Erdog?an, ‘the biggest damage one can cause to this country is to bring our differences to the political level’,which helps explain why the AKP ‘reproduces Kemalism’s distaste for “politicisation”, while rejecting the state’s tutelage over the political class’(??nar 2008:122).Unlike the previous authoritarian state and ideology,which denied the existence of social differences,the AKP accepts their existence (for instance,ethnic and religious identities) but not their presence at the political level, since it sees itself as the only legitimate representative of the national will.This results in ‘single actor pathology’ whereby the AKP sees and presents itself as the only actor of democratisation and provider of democratic solutions to the ossified problems of the country.
  At each critical juncture,the AKP’s populist political strategy has represented legitimate political adversaries as inner enemies,imposing a folk devil image that suppresses the potential of the nation. For instance, during the referendum campaign on constitutional amendments in 2010,the ‘coalition of evil’included opposition political parties,the media,PKK,and so on.As Erdog?an saw it:
CHP opposes the constitutional amendments.MHP does as well.So does the BDP.Some media institutions are opposed to these amendments.The gangs,which hope to benefit from darkness,oppose them.The elite,who rely on the status quo,oppose a ‘yes’vote,as does the terrorist organisation
[PKK].What could be more evident? CHP, MHP, BDP,YARSAV [the
Union of Judges and Prosecutors], and the terrorist organisation all came together against the people who say ‘yes’.Can Turkey benefit from such a coalition? This is the question.These groups can never agree on any issue in Turkey.They run away from democracy and freedom. However, they agreed to oppose the amendments that will enlarge the people’s horizons. This is a coalition of evil. (Hürriyet, 1 August 2010, quoted in Dinçs¸ahin 2012:638)
  Another example comes from the presidential election crisis of 2007. In response to mass protests against Abdullah Gül’s candidacy,Erdog?an stressed the primacy of the electoral majority, presenting Gül as the candidate of the millet rather than the tutelary elite bloc:‘The Assembly will have the final say,and the decision of our Assembly will be the decision of our nation’ (quoted in Dinçs¸ahin 2012:630),referring to the heart of the nation (Sine-i millet).Drawing on the Democrat Party’s right wing populist discourse of the 1950s, Erdog?an stated,‘We first started the process of “enough, the nation has the last word”; now we say “enough,the nation will make the decision”’(quoted in Dinçs¸ahin 2012: 634). This time, Erdog?an constructed a power bloc that included the Constitutional Court,the military,the current president,the Council of Higher Education, CHP and NGOs organising the republican rallies as the enemies of the ‘millet’(Dinçs¸ahin 2012:632).
  The AKP’s authoritarian populism clearly reveals itself in its distaste for the organised opposition groups,without limiting itself to expected movements like the working class,women or environmentalists,but in some cases even targeting bourgeois organisations that do not comply with the AKP’s views.For instance, again during the referendum campaign in 2010,the government put enormous pressure on such NGOs to express their support for the amendments. For. instance,T?SIAD, the association of the big bourgeoisie in Turkey, had some reservations about the changes concerning the judiciary.Erdog?an’s reaction was that ‘those who remain neutral today,on an issue related to the national benefit, will be neutralised tomorrow’(Radikal,18 August 2010).
  There is no doubt that one of the main targets of this authoritarian populism has been the labour movement. On the one hand, the AKP seems to adopt the politics of toleration in order to regulate or repress dissent,thereby leading to the de-politicisation or passivity of the working class.This politics of tolerance is motivated by the idea of order and peaceful coexistence and by the disassociation of subjects from their political struggle.Thus, the AKP’s politics of toleration is a means to produce a docile working-class subject,aimed at subsuming labour under the category of the poor through a policy of public philanthropy by transferring funds to the poor through increased public expenditure (Eg?ilmez 2012: 3–4, 8). However, dissident voices among the working class, which cannot be governed through such policies of toleration and neoliberal social policies,are repressed.For. instance,the May Day struggles of 2007,2008 and 2013 over reclaiming Istanbul’s Taksim square as a historical and symbolic place is a case in point. In every year, the attempts by the working class to gather were harshly repressed by the police, with Erdog?an’s statements making clear the AKP’s approach to the working class: ‘The end of the world comes when the tail leads the head’ (Ayaklar?n bas¸ oldug?u yerde k?yamet kopar) (Radikal, 22 April 2008).The AKP attempted to prevent the politicisation of labour through the May Day protests by turning the day into an official holiday for labour and solidarity in 2009,before revoking the 33-year-old ban on Taksim square May Day meetings in 2010.Currently,however,a recently started urban restructuring project in Taksim is being used to justify a permanent ban on collective protests in Taksim square.
  A final example may be given concerning agricultural producers. In June 2006, nut producers protested about the government’s unresponsive attitude when market prices fell below cost prices, particularly the stance of the then Minister of Finance, Kemal Unak?tan, whose son was a nut trader. Around 100,000 producers occupied a main highway for eight hours in a spontaneous and non-radical protest in support of their demands. Erdog?an’s reaction was to claim,‘this is an act in order to vilify the government and many illegal organisations participated in this protest . . .Once again,as it was the case in Diyarbak?r, women and children were put on the road.They held the traffic up.Nobody has the right to aggrieve the citizens for 8–9 hours’(Hürriyet,2 August 2006).
  The same repressive politics can be observed concerning identity politics. It should be underlined once again that, unlike the classical Turkish nationaliststatist approach, which denies the existence of cultural identity differences, the AKP has accepted their existence at a societal level while denying their autonomous politicisation in any way that it cannot control as the self-appointed sole representative of the nation.Thus, under the AKP, Sunni-Hanefi Muslims, especially the political and cultural elites, have become integrated into the political, economic and cultural echelons, but autonomous civil society organisations are not welcomed. Sunni-Hanefi middle-class elites participate in the decision-making processes through GONGOs (government-oriented nongovernmental organisations) rather than relatively autonomous NGOs. As to other cultural identity groups such as Alevis and the Roma, the AKP also followed policies of recognition, launching a series of reform initiatives (aç?l?m paketleri) with workshops that influenced governance strategy having a central role. However, the AKP did not allow autonomous organisations of these identity groups to represent them, preferring instead to co-opt pro-AKP organisations.Like the Ottoman millet system,the AKP’s policies of recognition are based on a hierarchical and asymmetric relationship between the dominant Sunni-Hanefi-Turkish Muslims and other identity groups (see Yalç?nkaya 2009).
  There is no doubt that the Kurdish question lies at the heart of any democratisation debate in Turkey. It is not possible here to present a detailed analysis of the development of this question under AKP rule (see ?andar 2009;Yavuz and ?zcan 2006; Musluk 2010). Having both internal and external political aspects, trapped in power politics complicated by tactics, strategies and conjunctural moments, the Kurdish question during the AKP era has changed dynamically. Certainly,the AKP’s political attitudes have been different from those of previous governments that based their policies on a politics of denial.Instead,the AKP has adopted the politics of recognition by accepting the existence of the Kurdish question, though without accepting the politicisation of this issue.Thus, once again,the AKP’s acceptance of societal differences is undermined by its rejection of their politicisation in the name of Turkey’s national unity and indivisibility (AK Parti 2012: 5, 24). The AKP’s policy on the Kurdish question has been consistently based on a dual strategy that differentiates between the ‘good Kurd’ and the ‘bad Kurd’.Good Kurds were seen as citizens and part of the AKP’s millet to the extent that they shared Sunni-Muslim identity. In other words, the AKP promoted religious identity through concrete policies to strengthen religious identity at the expense of Kurdish ethnic identity as a tool to depoliticise the ethno-political question.In addition,for the good Kurds,the AKP has promoted various legal reforms, especially within the context of EU membership and the Kurdish opening,which the AKP later renamed the Milli Birlik ve Kardes¸lik Projesi (National Unity and Brotherhood Project).However,such reforms fell a long way short of meeting the demands of the Kurdish social and political movement.
  Meanwhile, the AKP has attempted to eliminate the bad Kurds, which includes not only the armed branch of the Kurdish movement,i.e.PKK,but also all the politicised elements of the Kurdish movement from legal political parties to trade unionists.In other words,the ‘pathology of the single actor’is manifested here too. As in the other issues discussed above, due to its monolithic and majoritarian understanding of the national will, the AKP labels any other political actor concerning the Kurdish question as dividing the national will. Two main policies resulted from this approach that determined the AKP’s political attitude towards the bad Kurds.The first one was its use of classical nationalist rhetoric and its support of lynching attempts.For example,following protests by Kurdish people against the prime minister during his visit to Diyarbak?r in November 2008,Erdog?an’s reaction was:‘We said one nation,one state, one motherland.Those who oppose to this may go anywhere they want’ (Radikal,3 November 2008).Concerning attempted lynchings of Kurds by Turks in many cities, the prime minister supported them as the legitimate reaction of citizens against terrorists. For instance, following one such incident on 6 April 2005, just after the Kurdish spring festival of Newroz, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdog?an declared that ‘the sensitivity of the people is very important. When their national sensitivity is touched upon, the reaction to this will be different.Please,nobody should abuse this’(Milliyet, 8 April 2005).Similarly,after the 2006 Newroz protests,in which the police harshly intervened,Erdog?an said: ‘even if they are children or women, whoever they be, our security forces will make the necessary intervention’.The AKP’s second main policy has been the trials of KCK activists and cadres of the Kurdish social and political movement. The AKP was aiming to eliminate the Kurdish political movement before entering any peace negotiations.The so-called KCK trials started in April 2009, just after the local elections in which the Kurdish political movement defeated the AKP in Kurdish cities. By the beginning of 2013, around 8,000 activists of the Kurdish movement,among them politicians,elected mayors,trade unionists, journalists, NGO managers and activists, and academicians were in jail on remand, and their trials still continue.The current so-called peace negotiations and initiatives by the AKP government are run to a great extent non-publicly, still aiming to by-pass the Kurdish political movement.Thus,as with other issues, it seems that the AKP’s neoliberal-conservative populism has failed to expand the political sphere in the context of Kurdish question too. Rather, it has tried to depoliticise the issue and eliminate any actors who wish to politicise it.In short, an anti-political political stand has appeared regarding identity politics.
Conclusion
After almost two decades of crisis of political hegemony under neoliberal capitalism, the AKP could manufacture an expanded hegemony on the basis of neoliberal, conservative and authoritarian populism. It revitalised the neoliberal hegemony by articulating religious conservatism and neoliberalism, and could win succeeding elections with increasing electoral and popular support.However, hegemony is never absolute and complete but always incomplete and partially fixed, hence open to contestation.As Geoff Eley and Keith Nield (1980: 269) note:
hegemony is not a fixed and immutable condition . . .but is an institutionally negotiable process in which the social and political forces of contest, breakdown and transformation are constantly in play . . .[Hegemony is] a process of class relations in which concrete and determinate struggles for cultural,economic and political power or jurisdiction represent the decisive terrain of specific historical analysis.
  This is also valid for the AKP’s expanded hegemony.There are several explicit or implicit fissures regarding the AKP’s hegemonic project.To start with, even though the AKP’s economic performance has been successful in terms of economic growth and expansion in the context of ‘regulatory and social neoliberalism’,Turkish economy has its own structural weaknesses such as large current account deficits and high dependency on external short-term capital flows (?nis¸ 2012).Hence,a global crisis of capitalism or a less favourable global economic environment would have important negative effects on Turkey’s economic performance. This may, on the one hand, break the unity of the dominant classes and trigger the intra-class cleavages such as those between the big versus medium- and small-scale bourgeoisie, between those capital groups with a more openly Islamic conservative identity and more organic relations with the AKP and urban-based,more secular,capital groups.On the other hand, a severe economic crisis may trigger an important increase in unemployment and would also have negative effects on the redistributive capacity of the AKP’s neoliberal populism, which would mean a loss of hegemonic capacity for dominated classes.Such an economic crisis may also negatively affect important parts of urban middle classes, some of which would face unemployment, proletarianisation,and loss of consumption capacity.The world economic crisis in 2008 produced almost all of these effects, as a result of which the only elections in which AKP lost votes have been the local elections in spring 2009. In addition, such a moment of crisis may mobilise different fractions of the working class and lower middle class which are already affected by the ravages of neoliberal policies such as informal, unsecure, flexible conditions of work, commodification of public services and urban areas.
  The second important fissure may result from the combination of authoritarianism and conservatism in the AKP. The AKP’s neoliberal and conservative populism is authoritarian rather than democratic.As Gamble characterises such an approach: ‘It is populist because it draws upon popular discontent with many aspects’ of the preceding state form ‘to win support for a radical right programme.It is authoritarian because in the implementation of its programme it further increases the central power of the state and weakens opposition to it’ (Gamble 1988: 183). After the referendum for constitutional changes in September 2010 and the electoral victory in June 2011, AKP, which totally controlled the state apparatuses,intensified the authoritarian policies which had already come to the front after the 2007 general elections.The AKP’s authoritarian populism does not accept any social, political and even individual opposition or critic as legitimate.It rather blames them as being not part of the national will,being an attack to the national will,if not terrorist acts.In addition, the AKP’s majoritarian understanding of the national will and its capacity to control the state apparatus have pushed the party to be more daring in transforming the daily life in its own mirror image,in line with religious conservatism through such policies as the restrictive regulation on the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, anti-abortion regulations, promotion of childbirth and the injection of courses of religion into the educational system. Such conservative and authoritarian policies have already started to estrange urban, secular, more liberal-oriented population groups over whom the AKP could establish its hegemony before. Especially, urban lower (but also upper) middle classes, who feel themselves culturally, economically and politically excluded because of conservative and authoritarian policies, form an important point of fissure concerning the AKP’s hegemony.
  Last but not least, the fate of the Kurdish question forms one of the most important points of fissure for the AKP’s hegemonic project since the Kurdish movement, with its social, political, and armed branches, is the most organised and powerful oppositional actor of the country. In addition, the fate of the Kurdish question is also very critical for the AKP’s ambitious neo-Ottomanist imperial strategy in the Middle East within the framework of US neoimperialism.To the extent that the AKP continues to develop policies within the framework of single actor pathology by bypassing and eliminating the Kurdish movement,this may trigger re-militarisation of the Kurdish question,which will hence affect the balance of forces to an important extent.
